# IUCr CheckCIF/PLATON

There is a link between EnCIFer and the CheckCIF/PLATON service provided
by the IUCr: www.iucr.org.

The CheckCIF/PLATON service provides an additional level of checks of
CIF data to those present in EnCIFer. Performing these checks is
recommended before submission of a CIF to the CCDC. The checks work by
uploading your CIF to an IUCr web page which then displays the results.
The details of these checks are constantly being updated so please refer
to the relevant web pages for details.

To use the link, either select the CheckCIF/PLATON item on the Tools
menu, or click the appropriate toolbar icon.

- It is recommended to use EnCIFer to correct all error, warning and
    remarks messages before performing these additional checks.

- If the current CIF has been edited, then you will be first asked if
    you wish to save your edits. This is done because only the saved CIF
    data is sent for checking, not the current state of the **Text
    Editor**.

- You will then receive a prompt that the current CIF file name has
    been placed on the clipboard, click **OK**, or type **Esc** or
    **Return** to clear this prompt.

The appropriate IUCr web page should then be displayed in your default
web browser. Click on the **File name** box and then either select
**Paste** from the **Edit** menu, or use the **Ctrl+V** key combination
(**Command key+V** on macOS). Then press the **Send CIF for checking**
button. The report should now be displayed.

For web security reasons it is not possible for EnCIFer to automatically
insert in the correct file name, it has to be pasted in by the user.
